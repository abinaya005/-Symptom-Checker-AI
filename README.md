 Symptom Checker AI â€“ An NLP-Based Health Assistant (DSML Project):

A data science and machine learning mini-project that leverages **transformer-based NLP models** to answer symptom-related medical questions. Designed for offline use, this AI assistant demonstrates real-world application of **natural language understanding (NLU)** using **pretrained ML models** â€” no API key or cloud cost required.

Project Goal:

To build a lightweight, intelligent health assistant that applies **machine learning (ML)** and **NLP techniques** to respond to medical symptom queries through a simple and intuitive web interface using **Streamlit**.

 Domain Relevance â€“ Data Science & ML

This project showcases:
- **Data ingestion & handling** using pandas (optional MedQuAD support)
- **Transformer-based QA model (BERT)** using Hugging Face's `transformers`
- **Model inference pipeline** for real-time answer generation
- **Similarity-based evaluation** (optional) using `difflib` or cosine similarity
- **Interactive web deployment** using Streamlit â€” bridging ML & UI

It exemplifies how **machine learning models can be deployed in real-time applications**, especially in domains like healthcare.

 Why This Matters:

- Demonstrates applied **NLP** (a DSML core area)
- Uses **pre-trained ML models**, removing the need for GPU training
- Deploys a **user-facing ML system**, useful for real-world use cases
- Shows understanding of **model-to-product flow**, critical for DS roles

 Technologies Used:

- Python 
- Streamlit 
- Transformers (Hugging Face ðŸ¤—)
- Pandas
- Pretrained BERT (distilbert-base-uncased-distilled-squad)

 Deliverables:

- Working Streamlit UI with interactive Q&A
- Model-based answers to health questions
- Codebase ready for GitHub and deployment
- Optional result analysis via similarity metrics

 Ideal For:

- Final Year DSML mini project
- Hackathons or ML application demos
- Interview and resume portfolio

 Try Sample Questions
- What causes fever?
- What are symptoms of anemia?
- How to reduce dizziness?

 Next Steps (Optional):

- Integrate with MedQuAD / PubMedQA datasets
- Add CSV logging of symptomâ€“answer pairs
- Use semantic search for scalable context retrieval
- Build into chatbot with memory
